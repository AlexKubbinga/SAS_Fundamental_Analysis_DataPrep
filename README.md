# SAS Fundamental Analysis Data Cleaning and Preperation

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the original Jupyter Notebook as it is on an old computer. 
The HTML file still shows the process I used to aggregate and clean the different financial datasets for my SAS white paper. 
To download the html file of the workbook:
1. Click on SAS_Fundamental_Analysis_Workbook.html
2. Click on Raw
3. Right click and Save AS

After doing this the viewable HTML file of the workbook will start to download.
